## Introduction
While this is not my first home server, it is my first lab built with a clear focus on security operations. As a hobby, I have previously run a small personal home lab for **home automation and self-hosted services,** which helped me build a solid foundation in Linux, networking, and troubleshooting.

I later built my first dedicated **cybersecurity lab** using VMware Fusion on a Windows host. That environment was essential for turning theory into practice, but as the lab grew I began to hit hardware limitations, particularly around RAM usage and scalability.

To remove those constraints and enable further experimentation, I decided to rebuild the lab on **Proxmox VE**. Rather than migrating the existing environment, I chose to start over, using the opportunity to apply what I had learned and intentionally face new technical challenges.

## Lab Goals
The primary goal of this lab is to create a learning environment where encountering problems is expected and encouraged. Instead of avoiding complexity, the lab is designed to introduce new challenges that require investigation, experimentation, and hands-on problem solving.

The lab emphasizes:
- Learning through troubleshooting and experimentation  
- Facing unfamiliar technical challenges  
- Validating ideas and assumptions by testing and observation  

This approach creates continuous opportunities to build understanding and confidence by solving real problems rather than following predefined paths.
